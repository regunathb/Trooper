Trooper
=======

Trooper is a Java Framework for building applications using cell based architecture patterns.
It is an umbrella project for a number of things:

* Encouraging Service Oriented applications that can be distributed and scaled.
* Create a Java module-like system to build runtime profiles that applications can choose from : Basic, Service, Orchestration, Batch etc.
* Implement a number of patterns suited for scalability and deployment on commodity hardware. E.g. sharding, statelessness, data locality, fail-fast, checkpointing and recovery.
* Sub-projects that may be used totally independent of Trooper. E.g. the "mule-transport-rabbitmq" is a Maven project providing a RabbitMQ transport for Mule.
* Provide data models suited for service interactions, event driven design and metrics collection

The Trooper "examples" project group demonstrates usage of various application profiles supported by Trooper.
Documentation is continuously being added to the Wiki page of Trooper.
