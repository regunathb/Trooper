# Trooper

Trooper is a Java module like framework that provides various runtime profiles for building applications. Batch, Service and Orchestration runtime profiles are currently supported.
It is an umbrella project for a number of things:

* Build Service Oriented applications that can be distributed and scaled.
* Create a Java module-like system to build runtime profiles that applications can choose from : Basic, Service, Orchestration, Batch etc.
* Implement a number of patterns suited for scalability and deployment on commodity hardware. E.g. sharding, statelessness, data locality, fail-fast, checkpointing and recovery.
* Sub-projects that may be used totally independent of Trooper. E.g. the "mule-transport-rabbitmq" is a Maven project providing a RabbitMQ transport for Mule.
* Provide data models suited for service interactions, event driven design and metrics collection
